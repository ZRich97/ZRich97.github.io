Thanks for visiting my site! Here's some quick info about me:

- Graduated from <a href="http://calpoly.edu">Cal Poly SLO</a> with my B.S. in Software Engineering.
- Interned at <a href="https://www.jt4llc.com">JT4</a> in Las Vegas (my hometown), where I developed Java, Python, and Groovy projects.
- Interned at <a href="https://www.intuit.com">Intuit</a> in Mountain View as a DevOps Engineering intern. At Intuit, I developed a CICD solution that cut deployment time by ~60%. 
- When I started programming, I was developing Objective-C iOS apps in high school. Today, iOS development is still one of my side hobbies. 
- I'm interested in automation, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps in general.
- Java, Python, Swift, and Go are the languages I'm most comfortable with, but I've experimented with plenty of others.
