iOS development was my first exposure to programming, but I've never devoted enough time to it to build a real app. For my senior project at Cal Poly SLO, I wanted to take 
the opportunity to develop a fully-fledged app. The result: FitTrak. 

FitTrak is an application that allows users to track their meals, cardio, and weightlifting progress with a modern, simplistic UI. While it isnâ€™t complete, it's close! FitTrak
uses AWS services for user management, data storage, and CI.

My goals for the app were to learn how to design a programmatic iOS GUI and to implement the AWS lifecycle on iOS. 

Thanks for reading!
