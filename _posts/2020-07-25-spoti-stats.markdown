I use Spotify... a lot. Spotify provides some personalized streaming data in the form of their [Spotify Wrapped](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-12-05/spotify-wrapped-2019-reveals-your-streaming-trends-from-2010-to-now/) tool. They also make some user data available via their [API](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-top-artists-and-tracks/?type=artists&time_range=&limit=&offset=), allowing registered apps to gather data about your streaming usage and trends. As a new project to work on my web development skills, I decided to create a mini-Spotify Wrapped experience using the Spotify API.
